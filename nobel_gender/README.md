Synopsis:

Are women Nobel Prize winners younger than men on average? This code provides analysis to find an answer in the latest dataset of the prize recipients over the past 120 years. 

This folder contains:
README
nobel_prize_gender.ipynb: Jupyter notebook explaining each chunk of the code
nobel_prize_gender.py: python code only
datasets/life-expectancy.csv
datasets/nobel_1901_2020.csv

Motivation:
The motivation of this analysis comes from a random comment I heard after the Nobel Prize announcements 2020. The comment was that women seemed  to win Nobel Prizes at relatively younger ages than men.  My first reaction was that this was a hand-wavy statement based on cherry-picking evidence, hence I want to carry out an analysis and let the data speak for themselves. 

Tests:
You can run each chunk of the code in the Jupyter notebook.

Datasource:
nobel_1901_2020.csv are compiled from 
Datacamp's data scientist career track (www.datacamp.com%2Ftracks%2Fdata-scientist-with-python)
Nobel prize website (www.nobelprize.org)

life-expectancy.csv is downloaded from Our World in Data (https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fourworldindata.org%2Flife-expectancy).
