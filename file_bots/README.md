Synopsis:

I am tired of organising files by dragging them around or going with one folder at a time.
This module takes care of finding the right pdfs in the right folder, and merge them accordingly either
in the separate folders that they are found, or merge them all! 


This folder contains:
README
file_bot_pdf.ipynb: Jupyter notebook explaining how to import the module and use the class/methods
file_bot_pdf.py: python code module

Tests:
You can run each chunk of the code in the Jupyter notebook.
